## Vending Machine ##

Welcome to the vending machine fullstack homework submission for Jen Dunlap.

This solution has the `vending-machine-api` written in C# with a `vending-machine-ui` created using React.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin please note
- This project uses .NET Core 8, if you do not have this installed locally, you will want to install via the [Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
- For the frontend you will want to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) install as well as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Project Layout
This project is structured in two main directories

#### Backend (C# .NET Core API)
- **Location** `backend`
- **Structure**
  - Services:
    - `CsvVendingMachine`
    - `IVendingMachine`: The interface to use all methods within `CsvVendingMachine`.
  - Controllers:
    - `VendingMachineController`: API Controller to handle HTTP requests and to interface with the underlying  `CsvVendingMachine.cs` file.
  - Models: 
    - `Product`
    - `Transaction`
  
- **Main Technologies**: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core


#### Frontend (Create React App)
- **Location** `vending-machine-ui`
- **Structure**
  - Standard structure generated by `create-react-app`
- **Main Technologies**: React, Javascript

#### Running the Backend API
- Verify you have .NET 8 installed on your machine. 
- Navigate to the api directory with: 
`cd vending-machine/vending-machine-api`
- To start the API, run: `dotnet run`
- The API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Running the UI
- Verify you have Node and npm installed
- Navigate to the UI directory with: 
`cd vending-machine/vending-machine-ui`
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- To start the UI, run: `npm start`

#### Access the application
The application should open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. However, if it does not, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

### Notes
- In trying to respect the two hour time window...
  - All requested functionality has been implemented in the API but the UI is not set to take full advantage of all operations.
  - There are no tests created for this project. Given more time, there would be unit tests for both the API and the UI to verify basic functionality.
  - The refund transaction function only allows for refunding an entire transaction and it is also completely removed from the ledger.
    - In a real world scenario, the refund operation would allow for partial transaction refunds and it would also record the refund in the ledger as it is still a valid transaction.
  - The UI would be more intuitive, with more user facing error handling and accessibility considerations taken.
